# Grocery Store Management System

The Grocery Store Management System is a software application designed to streamline and simplify the operations of a grocery store. This system provides a range of features to help store owners manage inventory, track sales, handle customer data, and more. It aims to enhance efficiency and improve customer service in the grocery retail business.

## Introduction:
Grocery stores selling groceries and household supplies are omnipresent.
Unlike supermarkets, grocery stores are often private-owned entities, and
are often technologically less advanced. The first component of this
project focusses on resolving the same.

The first goal of the management system is to create a self-checkout
system for customers. It allows a customer to generate a bill on his/herown. Via self-checkout systems, wait-times as well as labour costs are
significantly reduced. This will be done using C++, MySQL and SQLite3
Library. The MySQL connectivity joins the billing interface to the
customer database of the store and records information such as
- name of customer,
- customer contact details,
- the items purchased and
- the quantity of the items purchased,
among many others.

The next part of the management system project is the employee
interface. It aims at providing trusted-employees access to certain aspects
of the store records after verification. Further, it will provide a means for
said employees to maintain a digital record of the products of the store.
This would enable them to
- check the inventory of the store,
- restock items,
- remove damaged items from inventory and
- see logs of customer purchases
among many others.

The third part of the management system is an interface for managers. It
aims at providing managers (verified through ID) access to employee
records. This includes
- viewing suppliers
- modifying suppliers
- viewing employee details
- promoting employees
- updating salaries of employees
among many others.

 ### Integration of the three components:
The three interfaces (user, employee and manager interface) can be
further integrated. The first component is meant to be operated
separately. The second and third components (employee and manager
interface) will be accessed through a common login page which will
give the user an option to opt for an ‘employee login’ or a ‘manager
login’. After verification of the same, the user will be able to access
the respective functionalities of the respective interfaces.
